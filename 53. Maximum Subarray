Sure! Kadane's Algorithm is a popular algorithm used to solve the "Maximum Subarray Problem," which is about finding the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers (containing at least one number) that has the largest sum.

Problem Statement:
Given an array of integers, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

Key Idea:
The core idea behind Kadane's Algorithm is to keep track of the maximum sum of the subarray ending at each position in the array. By doing this, we can then determine the maximum sum of any subarray in the array.

Steps to Implement Kadane's Algorithm:
Initialization:

Start by initializing two variables:
max_current to keep track of the maximum sum of the subarray that ends at the current position. Initialize it to the first element of the array.
max_global to keep track of the maximum sum found so far in the entire array. Initialize it to the first element of the array as well.
Iteration:

Loop through the array starting from the second element.
For each element, update max_current to be the maximum of:
The current element itself (this means starting a new subarray from the current element).
The current element plus max_current (this means extending the existing subarray to include the current element).
Update max_global to be the maximum of:
The current value of max_global.
The updated value of max_current.
Result:

After iterating through the entire array, max_global will hold the maximum sum of the contiguous subarray.
Example:
Letâ€™s consider an example array: [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]

Initialization:

max_current = -2 (first element)
max_global = -2
Iteration:

For the second element 1:
max_current = max(1, -2 + 1) = 1
max_global = max(-2, 1) = 1
For the third element -3:
max_current = max(-3, 1 - 3) = -2
max_global = max(1, -2) = 1
For the fourth element 4:
max_current = max(4, -2 + 4) = 4
max_global = max(1, 4) = 4
For the fifth element -1:
max_current = max(-1, 4 - 1) = 3
max_global = max(4, 3) = 4
For the sixth element 2:
max_current = max(2, 3 + 2) = 5
max_global = max(4, 5) = 5
For the seventh element 1:
max_current = max(1, 5 + 1) = 6
max_global = max(5, 6) = 6
For the eighth element -5:
max_current = max(-5, 6 - 5) = 1
max_global = max(6, 1) = 6
For the ninth element 4:
max_current = max(4, 1 + 4) = 5
max_global = max(6, 5) = 6
Result:

The maximum sum of the contiguous subarray is 6.

class Solution {
public:
    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        int curr=nums[0];
        int maxi=nums[0];

        for(int i=1;i<nums.size();i++){
            curr=max(nums[i],curr+nums[i]);
            maxi=max(maxi,curr);
        }
        return maxi;
    }
};
